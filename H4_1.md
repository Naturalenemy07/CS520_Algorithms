## Frequency Table Generation

### About

The first step of frequency table generation is to create a vector of length 123 elements.  The index of each element in the vector corresponds directly to the decimal representation of the character in ASCII.  The last five ASCII characters are not included as these special characters and DEL are not encountered in this homework assignment. For example, the element of index 97 is the character "a". The elements in the vector are structures called huffmanCharFreq. Each huffmanCharFreq contains the character as "key" and an integer as "count".  Count is set to 0 by default. The input file is read a character at a time, updating the associated chracter's count by adding 1 (based on its index and ASCII decimal representation).  Once built, the vector is cleaned up by removing elements that contain uneeded characters (most special characters and all non printing characters).  The table is then printed out on the command line. For further applications, the user can decide not print out the frequency table by setting an input value to false. 

### How to use

If the user has a C++ compiler, simply run the C++ file (huffman.cpp).  If not, the executable file(huffman.exe) can be run if using windows 11.  The program will ask which file needs to be read.  It can only read .txt files.  Once read, the frequency table will be printed out including a statement that the frequency table was generated. 

```bash
Name of file to open: <Input path to text file here>
```
