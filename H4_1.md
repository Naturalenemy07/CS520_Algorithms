## Frequency Table Generation

### About

The first step of frequency table generation is to create a vector of length 123 elements.  The index of each element in the vector corresponds directly to the decimal representation of the character in ASCII.  The last five ASCII characters are not included as these special characters and DEL are not encountered in this homework assignment. For example, the element of index 97 is the character "a". The elements in the vector are structures called huffmanCharFreq. Each huffmanCharFreq contains the character as "key" and an integer as "count".  Count is set to 0 by default. The input file is read a character at a time, updating the associated chracter's count by adding 1 (based on its index and ASCII decimal representation).  Once built, the vector is cleaned up by removing elements that contain uneeded characters (most special characters and all non printing characters).  The table is then printed out on the command line. For further applications, the user can decide not print out the frequency table by setting an input value to false. 

### How to use

If the user has a C++ compiler, simply run the C++ file (huffman.cpp).  If not, the executable file(huffman.exe) can be run if using windows 11.  The program will ask which file needs to be read.  It can only read .txt files.  

```bash
Name of file to open: <Input path to text file here>
```
Once read, the frequency table will be printed out including a statement that the frequency table was generated. See example from "test.txt" below.

```bash
Name of file to open: test.txt

The contents of "test.txt" in this example are from Cinxin Liu's book: *The Three-Body Problem*, in Chapter 16.  The text is when the protagonist, Wang Miao, and the police detective, Da Shi, are discussing with the mathemtician, Wei Cheng, the issue of solving the Three Body problem.  Interestingly, Wei Cheng describes using an evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem and how computers(at that time) are not powerful enough to solve it.  In our algorithms class, we learned that using more efficient algorithms is better than using more powerful computers.  However, still to this day, numerical solutions are our best method to approximating the three body problem. Note, the text doesn't contain upper case-it is assumed in the homework assignemnt that uppercase will not be used.

> "didn't you know about henri poincare?" wang miao interrupted wei to ask.
at the time, i didn't.  yes, i know that someone studying math should know
about a master like poincare, but i didn't worship masters and i didn't
want to become one, so i didn't know his work.  but even if i had, i would
have continued to pursue the three body problem.

> everyone seems to believe that poincare proved that the three body
problem couldn't be solved, but i think they're mistaken.  he only proved
sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and that the three body system
couldn't be solved by integrals.  but sensitivity is not the same as being
completely indeterminable.  it's just that the solution contains a greater
number of different forms.  what's needed is a new algorithm.

> back then, i thought of one thing: have you heard of the monte carlo
method?  ah, it's a computer algorithm often used for calculating the area
of irregular shapes.  specifically, the software puts the figure of interest in
a figure of known area, such as a circle, and randomly stikes it with
many tiny balls, never targeting the same spot twice.  after a large number
of balls, the proportion of balls that fall within the irregular shape 
compared to the total number of balls used to hit the circle will yield the area
of the shape.  of course, the smaller the balls used, the more accurate the 
result.

> although the method is simple, it shows how, mathematically, random
brute force can overcome precise logic.  it's a numerical approach that uses
quanitity to derive quality.  this is my strategy for solving the three body
problem.  i study the system moment by moment.  at each moment, the
spheres' motion vectors can combine in infinite ways.  i treat each combination
like a life form.  the key is to set up some rules: which combinations of
motion vectors are "healthy" and "beneficial", and which combinations
are "detrimental" and "harmful".  the former recieve a survival advantage 
while the latter are disfavored.  the computation proceeds by elimination 
the disadvantaged and preserving the advantaged.  the final combination 
that survives is the correct prediction for the system's next configuration, 
the next moment in time. 

>"it's an evolutionary algorithm," wang said.
"it's a good thing i invited you along." shi qiang nodded at wang. 
yes. only much later did i learn that term.  the distinguishing feature of
this algorithm is that it requires ultralarge amounts of computing power. 
for the three body problem, the computers we have now aren't enough.
