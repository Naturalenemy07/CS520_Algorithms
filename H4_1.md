## Frequency Table Generation

### About

The first step of frequency table generation is to create a vector of length 123 elements.  The index of each element in the vector corresponds directly to the decimal representation of the character in ASCII.  The last five ASCII characters are not included as these special characters and DEL are not encountered in this homework assignment. For example, the element of index 97 is the character "a". The elements in the vector are structures called huffmanCharFreq. Each huffmanCharFreq contains the character as "key" and an integer as "count".  Count is set to 0 by default. The input file is read a character at a time, updating the associated chracter's count by adding 1 (based on its index and ASCII decimal representation).  Once built, the vector is cleaned up by removing elements that contain uneeded characters (most special characters and all non printing characters).  The table is then printed out on the command line. For further applications, the user can decide not print out the frequency table by setting an input value to false.
