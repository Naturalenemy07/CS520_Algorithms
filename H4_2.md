## Huffman Binary Encoding

### About / How to use

A text file is read as input. First a frequency table is generated and then used to make a Huffman binary tree.  The Huffman binary tree is built using a priority queue. The root node of the priority queue is used as input for a function that generates the binary encoding.  The encoder recursively navigates through the binary tree, (0 for left, and 1 for right movements). The huffman binary encoding is then printed on teh command line.  To run the program, if the user has a C++ compiler, simply run the C++ file (huffman.cpp).  If not, the executable file(huffman.exe) can be run if using Windows 11.  The program will ask which file needs to be read.  It can only read .txt files.  

```bash
Name of file to open: <Input path to text file here>
```
See example from "test.txt" below of the binary encoding.

```bash
Name of file to open: test.txt
