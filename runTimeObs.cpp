//set variables (n) number of ints, (range), and (m) number of ints to search within n

// generate (n) integers and save to an array (n_ints)

// sort list of (n) integers

// generate list of (m) integers to be searched and save to seperate array (m_ints)

// create array (linear_search_times, and binary_search_times) to store all search times, initialize (lin_num_found, and bin_num_found) to store numebr of integers found

// for each number in M_ints, search using linear search method
// // keep track of time to perform search using <chrono>, save the time (in milliseconds) to (search_times)

// for each number in M_ints, search using binary search method
// // keep track of time to perform search using <chrono>, save the time (in milliseconds) to (search_times)

// once completed, calculate average time to seach

// print out (n), (m), number found and average time spent searching for each ex: 
// (n): 100, (m): 50, (num found): #, (linear avg time): # secs, (binary avg time): # secs
